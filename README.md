# 💖 Lavinia_OS  
*Not just a portfolio… it’s a tiny computer living inside your browser*

## 👩‍💻 Who am I?
Hi, I’m **Lavinia Nael Alfons** 👋  
A Front-End Developer who loves mixing **logic with aesthetics**.

I come from a **Mathematics & Computer Science** background, but my heart is always leaning toward design, colors, animations, and ✨ vibes ✨.  
I enjoy taking things that are *supposed* to be “technical and boring” and turning them into something **cute, interactive, and full of personality**.

## 🕹 What is this project?
**Lavinia_OS 2025** is my portfolio reimagined as a **retro operating system**.  
Think Win95 energy 🎧 but make it **girly** — pinks, lavenders, hearts, sparkles… yes please 💅

Instead of scrolling through a basic page, you’re actually:
- opening apps  
- dragging windows  
- exploring things at your own pace  

Basically… you’re playing with my portfolio 🖱️

## 🤔 Why a Retro OS?
Honestly? A few reasons:

1. **I love structure**  
   As a Math & CS graduate, windows, grids, and organized layouts just *make sense* to my brain. This OS-style interface reflects how I naturally think and build.

2. **Enough with grey, boring tech sites**  
   I wanted to prove that strong engineering doesn’t have to look serious or dull.  
   Clean code + pink UI = perfectly valid combo 🩷

3. **Interaction > scrolling**  
   I didn’t want you to just “read about me.”  
   I wanted you to **discover** things by clicking, opening, and moving stuff around — like a real desktop.

## 🚀 What’s inside?
- 🖥️ **Responsive Desktop**  
  Icons align and wrap automatically based on screen size (no manual chaos involved 😌)

- 🪟 **Real Window Dragging**  
  The entire window frame is draggable — not just the header  
  + smart boundaries and a soft snap-back effect

- 🧼 **Clean first impression**  
  No windows open by default. You get a calm, empty desktop before diving in.

- ✨ **Lively Animations**  
  Staggered icon entrances, floating hearts and sparkles, and hover effects that make everything feel alive

## 🛠 Built with
- **React** – keeping everything modular and organized  
- **Vite** – fast, smooth, and lightweight  
- **Tailwind CSS** – retro borders, bevel effects, and custom colors  
- **Framer Motion** – all the smooth movement and UI magic  
- **Lucide Icons** – clean and consistent icons across the OS
